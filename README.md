getting unix to understand plain english with chat gtp


Okay , I need to process a file , which is in this repo.

I need to extract all the words starting with ex into a ordered list.

usually i'd switch my brain into sed, awk, grep etc etc.

But what if i asked chatgtp to help me?

this is a very simple example, but it's been able to solve much more compicated quick hack parsing and processing problems.

It's like it's the year 2038 ...TODAY! enjoy!
